# Neurox-v

ðŸ‘‹ This is the assessment for full stack software engineer within [Neuroventis](https://neuroventis.care/).

One small application has been started containing a server part and a client part.

You need Node.js > 14 to run this exercise.


## Server
The server application has been created using [Koa.js](https://koajs.com/).
To start the application navigate to the `server` folder and run:

1. `npm install`
2. `node index.js`

The application contains a JSON file that when booted up serves as a in-memory database.

## Client

The client application has been created using React, concretely via `create-react-app` script.
To start the application navigate to the `client` folder and run:

1. `npm install`
2. `REACT_APP_SERVER_URL='http://localhost:5000' npm start`

Where REACT_APP_SERVER_URL contains the URL of the server application.
